# Graphical Overhaul Plan

Full visual overhaul: shaders, particles, animations, weather, UI juice, and post-processing.
All changes are code-only (no external art assets needed).

---

## Phase 1: Shader Foundation

### 1a. Water Shader
- Custom `.gdshader` on water Polygon2Ds
- Sine-wave vertex distortion for ripple effect
- Specular highlight that shifts with time
- Edge foam (brighter alpha at shoreline)
- Per-pool color tinting preserved

### 1b. Post-Processing (CRT + Vignette + Color Grading)
- Full-screen ColorRect with shader on CanvasLayer (top z-index)
- Subtle horizontal scanlines (alpha ~0.06)
- Vignette darkening at screen edges
- Color grading: warm shift during day, cool blue at night (reads CanvasModulate tint)

### 1c. Water Edge Glow
- Additive-blend ColorRect around water body edges
- Subtle luminous teal glow, stronger at night
- Pulses slowly with sine wave

---

## Phase 2: Particle Systems

### 2a. Replace Hand-Coded Particles with CPUParticles2D
- **Dust puffs** — footstep-triggered, cloud-like, sandy brown
- **Water splash** — on scoop, blue droplets with gravity
- **Bubbles** — rising from water bodies, varied sizes
- **Fireflies** — warm glow with randomized drift paths

### 2b. New Ambient Particles
- **Pollen/spores** — slow-drifting dots across entire screen, very subtle
- **Mist wisps** — near water bodies, low opacity, slow horizontal drift
- **Leaves** — occasional leaf falling from treeline area

---

## Phase 3: Parallax & Depth

### 3a. Parallax Background

- Frequency based on how full inventory is
- Drips hit ground and fade out

### 12b. Footprints in Mud
- Near water edges, each footstep leaves a darkened mark on the ground
- Fades out over 3-4 seconds
- Only on dirt/mud areas (not on solid ground far from water)

### 12c. Idle Animations

## Phase 13: Environment Storytelling

### 13a. Drain Visual Progression
- As swamp water_level drops below thresholds, reveal hidden objects:
  - 75%: mud patches at edges
  - 50%: exposed rocks, old boot
  - 25%: rusty sign, fish bones
  - 0%: treasure chest / ancient artifact (visual reward)
- Objects are pre-placed ColorRect groups, visibility toggled by water level

### 13b. Wet Ground Zones
- Dark, slightly glossy dirt band around each water body
- Width proportional to current water level
- Shrinks as swamp drains
- Subtle shimmer shader or alpha pulse

### 13c. Dynamic Shadows

---

## Phase 14: Extra Shaders

### 14a. Heat Shimmer
- Vertex distortion shader on a screen-wide ColorRect
- Active during daytime only, fades in/out with day cycle
- Disabled during rain
- Subtle — just enough to feel warm

### 14b. Water Reflections
- Flipped, distorted render of sky/cloud colors on water surface
- Shader reads sky gradient and mirrors it with wave distortion
- Low opacity (~0.15), blends with existing water color
- More visible on calmer (smaller) pools

---

## Phase 15: World Progression (Game Gets Prettier)

### 15a. Desaturated-to-Vibrant
- Track total gallons drained as a "world health" score
- Early game: slight desaturation shader (saturation ~0.7)
- As you drain, saturation gradually rises to 1.0 then slightly beyond (1.05)
- Applied via the post-processing shader uniform

### 15b. Growing Vegetation on Drained Land
- When a swamp drops below water level thresholds, spawn new plants on exposed land
- Small flowers, grass tufts, saplings appear over time
- Tween them growing from size 0 to full — visible sprouting effect
- More swamps drained = lusher world

### 15c. Background Life Scaling
- Bird silhouettes crossing the sky — count increases with progress
- More butterflies and dragonflies spawn as world heals
- Clouds get slightly larger/fluffier at high progress
- Ecosystem visually recovering

---

## Phase 16: Player Readability & Juice

- When move speed multiplier > 1.5x, spawn trailing motion streaks
- Horizontal lines behind player, fade quickly (0.15s)
- More lines and longer at higher speeds
- Subtle white/light color, low opacity

### 16c. Coin Fly Animation
- On earning money: golden dot particles fly from player toward HUD money counter
- On spending money: dots fly from HUD counter downward
- Bezier curve path for satisfying arc motion
- Connects the game world to the UI

---

## Phase 17: Atmosphere

### 17a. Pump Steam
- When selling water at pump, white steam particles rise from pipe
- CPUParticles2D: upward drift, expand, fade
- Brief mechanical chug visual (pump body jiggles 1px)

### 17b. Morning Mist

- Appears during sunrise transition, burns off over 30s
- Thin horizontal wisps, warm golden tint from sunrise light

### 17c. Aurora Borealis
- Rare nighttime event (~10% chance per night cycle)
- Slow-moving colored curtains across top of sky
- Green/purple/blue gradient bands, undulating via sine offset
- Fades in/out gently over 20s

### 17d. Birds & Owls
- Daytime: bird silhouettes (2-3 ColorRect V-shapes) cross sky left to right
- Occasional flock (5-8 birds in loose formation)
- Nighttime: single owl silhouette perched in treeline, glowing yellow eye dots
- Owl occasionally blinks (eye alpha flash)

---

## Phase 18: Terrain Polish

### 18a. Dithered Transitions
- Checkerboard/dither pattern at boundaries between terrain types
- Grass-to-dirt: alternating green/brown pixels in a 2-3px band
- Dirt-to-mud: alternating dry/wet brown pixels near water
- Implemented via small repeating ColorRect pattern or shader

### 18b. Shoreline Ripples
- When player is near water (not scooping), concentric ring ripples expand from nearest water edge
- Small expanding circle outlines (Line2D or shader)
- Fade out over 1s, new ripple every 0.8s
- Only when standing still or walking slowly near edge

## Implementation Order (Recommended)
1. Phase 1 (shaders — water, post-processing, glow) — foundation everything else builds on
2. Phase 14 (extra shaders — heat shimmer, reflections) — while we're doing shaders
3. Phase 3 (parallax) — restructures scene tree, do early
4. Phase 2 (particles) — replaces existing effects
5. Phase 5 (vegetation) — quick win, big visual impact
6. Phase 11 (lighting) — enhances day/night which already exists
7. Phase 15 (world progression) — desaturation shader, growing vegetation
8. Phase 13 (environment storytelling) — drain progression, wet ground, shadows
9. Phase 4 (weather) — builds on particles + lighting
10. Phase 17 (atmosphere) — pump steam, mist, aurora, birds
11. Phase 6 (wildlife) — builds on existing creatures
12. Phase 8 (camel) — isolated system
13. Phase 16 (player readability) — outline, speed lines, coin fly
14. Phase 12 (player immersion) — drip trail, footprints, idle, tool swap
15. Phase 18 (terrain polish) — dithered transitions, shoreline ripples
16. Phase 7 (screen effects) — layer on top
17. Phase 9 (tool effects) — builds on particles
18. Phase 10 (UI juice) — independent, can do anytime
