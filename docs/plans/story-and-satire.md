# Story & Political Satire Plan

## Core Premise

The government campaigns on "draining the swamp." To technically fulfill the promise, they hire ONE GUY (the player) with zero budget and zero tools. They expect him to fail quietly while politicians take credit. The player actually succeeds, and each drained pool exposes more buried corruption. The politicians panic as their hiding spots literally drain away.

---

## Tone

Absurdist dark comedy. Equal-opportunity mockery of both parties. The corruption is so blatant and dumb it's funny. Politicians are thinly-veiled parodies with silly names.

---

## Recurring Characters (Thinly Veiled Parodies)

- **Senator Swampsworth (R)** — The "tough on swamps" guy who secretly owns swampfront property. Loud, always on TV, says nothing of substance.
- **Congresswoman Lobbyton (D)** — Claims to care about the environment, actually cares about donor dinners. Uses the swamp program for photo ops.
- **"The Consultant"** — A shadowy figure who keeps getting paid $500K to produce reports that say "more research needed." Nobody knows his real name.
- **Mayor Kickback** — Local mayor who approved the swamp draining but keeps redirecting the drainage toward his ex-wife's property.
- **Press Secretary Spinwell** — Government spokesperson. Gets increasingly desperate explaining why draining the swamp is "going according to plan" as it clearly isn't.

## Opening Sequence (Two Newspapers)

### Newspaper 1 — The Announcement
```
THE SWAMP GAZETTE
Vol. XLII, No. 6 — Wednesday, March 13

CONGRESS ANNOUNCES HISTORIC "DRAIN THE SWAMP" INITIATIVE
Bipartisan bill allocates $200M to swamp removal program

In a rare show of unity, both parties voted unanimously to fund a
comprehensive swamp-draining program. "This is what the American people
voted for," said Senator Swampsworth (R), standing beside Congresswoman
Lobbyton (D), who added, "We are fully committed to transparency."

The program's budget includes $180M for "administrative oversight,"
$19.5M for "consulting fees," and $500 for "field operations." Critics
noted the field operations budget could only cover a single employee
with no equipment.
```

### Newspaper 2 — The Reality
```
THE SWAMP GAZETTE
Vol. XLII, No. 7 — Thursday, March 14

GOVERNMENT HIRES LOCAL MAN TO DRAIN ENTIRE SWAMP
"Just use your hands," supervisor reportedly instructed

The sole employee of the new Swamp Draining Initiative reported for
work yesterday to find no office, no tools, and a handwritten note
reading "good luck." When asked about equipment, a government liaison
shrugged and said, "Budget constraints."

The man was last seen kneeling at the edge of the swamp, scooping
water with his bare hands. Neighbors describe the scene as "either
inspiring or deeply concerning." Several elected officials were seen
celebrating at a nearby steakhouse.
