## TITLE SCREEN — Intro Newspapers (New Game)

Two newspapers shown back-to-back before gameplay begins.

### Newspaper 1
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 6 — Wednesday, March 13

**CONGRESS ANNOUNCES HISTORIC "DRAIN THE SWAMP" INITIATIVE**
*Bipartisan bill allocates $200M to swamp removal program*

In a rare show of unity, both parties voted unanimously to fund a comprehensive swamp-draining program. "This is what the American people voted for," said Senator Swampsworth (R), standing beside Congresswoman Lobbyton (D), who added, "We are fully committed to transparency."

The program's budget includes $180M for "administrative oversight," $19.5M for "consulting fees," and $500 for "field operations." Critics noted the field operations budget could only cover a single employee with no equipment.

### Newspaper 2
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 7 — Thursday, March 14

**GOVERNMENT HIRES LOCAL MAN TO DRAIN ENTIRE SWAMP**
*"Just use your hands," supervisor reportedly instructed*

The sole employee of the new Swamp Draining Initiative reported for work yesterday to find no office, no tools, and a handwritten note reading "good luck." When asked about equipment, a government liaison shrugged and said, "Budget constraints."

The man was last seen kneeling at the edge of the swamp, scooping water with his bare hands. Neighbors describe the scene as "either inspiring or deeply concerning." Several elected officials were seen celebrating at a nearby steakhouse.

## MILESTONE NEWSPAPERS (1 per pool drained, 10 total)

Shown as popup newspaper overlays when each pool is fully drained.

### Pool 0: Puddle ($25/gal, 5 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 8 — Friday, March 15

**SWAMP EMPLOYEE SOMEHOW DRAINS PUDDLE**
*Government takes credit; allocates $0 for further progress*

"This proves the system works," said Press Secretary Spinwell at a hastily organized press conference. When asked how a man with no tools managed to drain a puddle, Spinwell responded, "American ingenuity," before being escorted away by aides.

Senator Swampsworth released a statement taking personal credit for the puddle's removal, calling it "a direct result of my leadership." Records show he has never visited the swamp.

Congressman Goodwell (I) called the achievement "proof that one honest worker can outperform an entire bureaucracy." He has introduced a bill to increase the field operations budget.

### Pool 1: Pond ($50/gal, 50 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 12 — Tuesday, March 19

**SWAMP MAN CONTINUES, POLITICIANS MILDLY ANNOYED**
*"We didn't think he'd still be here," admits unnamed official*

The lone swamp drainer has now cleared a second body of water, prompting mild concern among government officials who assumed he would have quit by now.

"The plan was for him to get discouraged and leave," said an anonymous source. "Nobody actually wants the swamp drained. Have you seen what's in there?"

Only Congressman Goodwell voted against a motion to "quietly reassign" the drainer. "Let the man work," he said.

### Pool 2: Marsh ($100/gal, 500 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 19 — Tuesday, March 26

**DRAINING REVEALS BURIED CAMPAIGN SIGNS FROM 1987**
*"Those were supposed to stay buried," says nervous city councilman*

The draining of the marsh has uncovered hundreds of old campaign signs, several unmarked filing cabinets, and what appears to be a shredded Rolodex belonging to a former mayor.

City officials have requested that the drainer "please stop finding things." A cease-and-desist letter was drafted but could not be delivered because no one knows the drainer's name.

Congressman Goodwell has filed a formal complaint about missing funds in the Initiative budget. "Someone is going to answer for this," he said.

### Pool 3: Bog ($250/gal, 5,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 28 — Thursday, April 4

**SCIENTISTS WARN: DRAINING SWAMP "COULD DISRUPT ECOSYSTEM"**
*Study funded by Senator Swampsworth's wife's foundation*

A new study warns that continued swamp draining could endanger several species of mosquito and an "unusually large" population of leeches.

"Won't somebody think of the mosquitoes?" pleaded a lobbyist from the newly formed Americans for Swamp Preservation. The organization was registered yesterday and lists its address as Senator Swampsworth's vacation home.

Congressman Goodwell, recently appointed chair of the Swamp Oversight Committee, said the study "raises valid concerns" and recommended "a measured pace." He was later seen at the same donor dinner as Swampsworth.

Officials have ordered "emergency water rerouting" to adjacent bodies of water, citing "ecological balance."

> **SABOTAGE:** 7% of the next pool's water is added back.

### Pool 4: Swamp ($500/gal, 50,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 35 — Thursday, April 11

**ACTUAL SWAMP NOW DRAINED, GOVERNMENT IN EMERGENCY SESSION**
*Congress votes to rename remaining water "Definitely Not A Swamp"*

In an unprecedented move, Congress held an emergency session to address the fact that the swamp has been drained. A bipartisan resolution was passed to reclassify all remaining bodies of water as "Definitely Not Swamps."

"You can't drain what isn't a swamp," explained Congresswoman Lobbyton, visibly sweating. Legal experts say the reclassification has no practical effect.

Congressman Goodwell was notably absent from the emergency session. His office said he was "consulting with stakeholders." The stakeholders were later identified as SwampCo board members.

> **WANTED POSTER** appears on shop wall after this pool.
> **HELICOPTER FLYOVERS** begin (every 60 seconds).

### Pool 5: Lake ($1,000/gal, 500,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 44 — Saturday, April 20

**MAN WITH BUCKET OUTPERFORMS ENTIRE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM**
*$200M initiative has produced 0 results; one guy has drained 6 bodies of water*

An audit of the Swamp Draining Initiative reveals that of the $200M budget, $0 was spent on actual draining. Meanwhile, one man with purchased tools has drained six bodies of water.

The Consultant's latest $500,000 report recommends "continued monitoring." It is three pages long and two of them are the cover page.

Congressman Goodwell declined to comment on the audit findings, calling it "a distraction from the real issues." He has purchased a lakefront property.

Government tanker trucks were spotted dumping water into the reservoir overnight. Officials deny everything.

### Pool 6: Reservoir ($2,000/gal, 5,000,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 53 — Monday, April 29

**BOTH PARTIES ISSUE RARE JOINT STATEMENT: "STOP DRAINING"**
*Republicans and Democrats agree for first time since naming a post office*

In what historians are calling "the most bipartisan moment in decades," both parties have jointly demanded that the swamp drainer cease all operations immediately.

"Some things should stay wet," said Senator Swampsworth. "The swamp is part of our national heritage," added Congresswoman Lobbyton. Neither could explain why they suddenly care about swamp preservation.

Congressman Goodwell co-signed the joint statement, calling the drainer's work "reckless and irresponsible." His campaign has received $400,000 from Americans for Swamp Preservation.

### Pool 7: Lagoon ($4,000/gal, 50,000,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 61 — Tuesday, May 7

**LEAKED DOCUMENTS SHOW POLITICIANS STORED VALUABLES IN SWAMP**
*"It's not corruption, it's 'waterproof asset management,'" says lawyer*

Draining of the lagoon has revealed waterproof containers belonging to multiple elected officials. Contents include offshore account records, blackmail photographs, and what appears to be "a truly staggering amount of cash."

A spokesperson for the implicated officials called the discovery "a coincidence" and suggested the containers "must have floated there from somewhere else."

Among the waterproof containers: a folder labeled "Goodwell — Phase 2." Contents not yet disclosed. Goodwell's office called it "opposition research that was planted."

In a final act of defiance, fire hydrants across the county were opened simultaneously, flooding the bayou with municipal water. The water bill was charged to "field operations."

### Pool 8: Bayou ($8,000/gal, 500,000,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 70 — Thursday, May 16

**POLITICIANS FLEE COUNTRY AS BAYOU DRAINAGE REVEALS PAPER TRAIL**
*Senator Swampsworth's passport found; he's "on vacation indefinitely"*

At least fourteen elected officials have left the country following the draining of the bayou, which exposed a comprehensive paper trail linking both parties to decades of corruption.

Senator Swampsworth was last seen boarding a private jet to a "non-extradition country." His office says he is "on a fact-finding mission" and will return "when the swamp refills."

Congressman Goodwell remains in the country, having been promoted to Senate Majority Leader following "several vacancies." He has announced a new initiative to "protect our waterways."

### Pool 9: The Atlantic ($15,000/gal, 10,000,000,000 gallons)
**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — Vol. XLII, No. 82 — Friday, May 30

**THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IS DRAINING AND IT'S ONE MAN'S FAULT**
*"We should have given him a shovel," admits former Press Secretary*

Former Press Secretary Spinwell, speaking from an undisclosed location, expressed regret over the government's handling of the swamp drainer. "In hindsight, maybe we should have just given him a shovel and let him drain the puddle. Instead we gave him nothing and he drained the ocean."

The drainer could not be reached for comment. He was last seen heading east with a very large bucket.

Senate Majority Leader Goodwell denounced the drainer as "an enemy of the wetlands" and signed an executive order to "restore and protect the swamp." He was last seen touring a private island with real estate developers.

**DRAINER ARRESTED IN DRAMATIC ISLAND RAID**
*CIA intercepts lone employee moments before confrontation with officials*

In a dramatic conclusion to the Swamp Draining Initiative, CIA operatives intercepted the lone employee on the private island moments before he could confront officials. The drainer, armed with what witnesses described as "some kind of hammer," was airlifted from the scene in federal custody.

WHERE ARE THEY NOW:

SENATE MAJORITY LEADER GOODWELL — Issued blanket pardons for all implicated officials. "There was no corruption. There was never any corruption. Focus on what matters."

SENATOR SWAMPSWORTH — Fully exonerated. Appointed head of new "Wetlands Restoration Committee." Budget: $600M.

CONGRESSWOMAN LOBBYTON — Published memoir "I Was The Victim" which debuted at #1. Currently suing the drainer for defamation.

THE CONSULTANT — Hired to lead investigation into the drainer. Budget: $2M. Report due "eventually."

MAYOR KICKBACK — Reinstated. Awarded Medal of Public Service for "enduring the swamp crisis."

PRESS SECRETARY SPINWELL — Promoted. Now leads campaign to rebrand draining as "aquatic vandalism."

JEFF — No comment.

THE DRAINER — Held at undisclosed location. Charges include "environmental terrorism" and "misappropriation of government spoon."

DRAIN THE SWAMP — Thanks for playing!

4. Final newspaper fades in:

**THE SWAMP GAZETTE** — SPECIAL EVENING EDITION

**GOODWELL: "IT WAS ALL FAKE. MOVE ON."**
*All officials pardoned, swamp ordered refilled, public told to "focus on more important things"*

Senate Majority Leader Goodwell held a press conference today declaring the entire swamp scandal "fabricated" and urging citizens to "focus on more important things."

"There was no island. There were no officials. The swamp was always fine," Goodwell said, standing ankle-deep in swamp water. "This was a coordinated hoax by one disgruntled employee with a spoon."

All seven officials have been pardoned and reinstated. The swamp has been ordered refilled at a cost of $400M to taxpayers. The drainer's $500 field operations budget has been reclassified as "misappropriated funds" and added to his growing list of charges.

The drainer remains in federal custody. His court-appointed attorney says he is "doing fine" and "has requested a larger spoon, which was denied."
