# Brainstorming Mode

Help brainstorm ideas for this project through collaborative dialogue.

## Topic: $ARGUMENTS

## Process

1. **Understand the idea** - Check relevant project files first (data files, design docs, existing code) to understand what already exists
2. **Ask questions one at a time** - Clarify what the user wants. Prefer multiple-choice questions when possible. Only one question per message.
3. **Explore approaches** - Propose 2-3 different directions with trade-offs. Lead with your recommendation.
4. **Present ideas in small chunks** - Share 3-5 ideas at a time, check if they're on the right track before continuing
5. **Refine** - Iterate based on feedback until the user is happy

## Key Principles

- One question at a time, don't overwhelm
- Multiple choice when possible, open-ended when needed
- Keep it fun and creative
- Consider what already exists in the project
- YAGNI - don't over-design, keep ideas simple and implementable
- When done, offer to write the ideas to a doc in docs/plans/
